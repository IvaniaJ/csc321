# CSC321
CSC-321 Networking
Final Project

This is the Final Project for CSC- 321 Networking. It starts with the excercises that are available on Zguide (https://zguide.zeromq.org/docs/chapter1/#Getting-the-Message-Out) & (https://zguide.zeromq.org/docs/chapter1/#Divide-and-Conquer).


 The exercises for the first link include the weather server application and the weather client application. The exercises for the second link include task ventilator application, task worker application, and task sink application.

 We were required to work through these exercises and get them running. Then we were to use Docker and run these applications while also using tcpdump to capture packet data. 

 After this, we were required to merge the packet capture files in a single file. This was done using Wireshark.
